# Module 14 - Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview:

The purpose of the project is to use Tableau to visualize data of a bikesharing program based out of Manhattan. We will use the findings of the analysis to determine the 
viability of a similar bikesharing program in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results:

1. People start their trip in the busy metropolitan area of Manhattan.

2. They start their commute to work in the hours of 6-9AM and commute home between 5-7PM.

3. Most commutes are 20 minutes or fewer.

4. More men like to use the program for their daily commutes but the behaviour is similar for everyone.

5. These maps show that the relative behaviour between the genders is similar, proving this program can be truly universal.

6. More men are subscribers and therefore are more invested to use the program.

7. People end their day in roughly the same area as they started proving this program is used primarily for commuting.

## Summary:

The results show that the bikesharing program is mostly used for commuting and weekend biking trips. There is a gender gap where males are more likely to use the program than 
females but when you look at slide 6, it shows that more men are subscribers. This suggests that the program can be made more popular with a marketing campaign to enroll more 
women as subscribers and increasing brand loyalty. Two additional visualizations that would help are : Age vs Trip Duration and Trips by Age(weekday per hour) in order to get a 
better sense of the demographics that use the program and match it to the demographics in Des Moines to further explore the viability of this program in a smaller city.
